# SMART MOBILE APPLICATION FOR TRACKING VEHICLE MOVEMENTS IN RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES
# Group No: CEI - 17

## Project OverviewThis project aims to develop a smart mobile application to track and monitor vehicle movements within gated residential communities. The application enhances security, access control, and visitor management by maintaining real-time records of vehicles entering and exiting the premises. It leverages GPS tracking, mobile notifications, and cloud-based logging to support both residents and security personnel with transparent, efficient, and user-friendly vehicle monitoring.

## Objectives
- Develop a mobile application to track vehicle entries and exits in residential communities.
- Provide real-time logs and access records for security guards and residents.
- Enable visitor vehicle registration, number plate scanning, and entry pass management.
- Improve the overall security infrastructure of gated societies using technology.
- Integrate notifications and data storage for audit purposes.



## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
- **Libraries**: BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas, NumPy etc.
- **Frameworks**: Flask (for backend), Django (MVC/MVT architecture)
- **Tools**: OpenCV, TensorFlow/Keras (or PyTorch) â€“ for ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) Image Processing, Object Detection, Model Deployment, BeautifulSoup, Requests, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, JSON, Python                Virtual Environments.
## How to Use
1. Clone or download the project from the GitHub repository to your local system.
2. Install necessary dependencies, such as Android Studio (for mobile development) or required libraries if the backend uses Python or Node.js.
3. Open the project in your preferred IDE (e.g., Android Studio for mobile, VS Code for backend).
4. Run the mobile application on an emulator or physical Android device.
5. Register users (residents and security personnel) through the app.
6. Log vehicle entries and exits using the form, QR scan, or number plate input.
7. View and monitor logs of all vehicle movements in real-time.
8. Enable notifications to alert residents of visitor entries or suspicious activity.
9. Access admin features for generating reports, setting permissions, and monitoring historical data.
